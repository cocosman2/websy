<h1>Your Fate</h1>
<p>Warm light pours out. You step inside, comforted by the laughter and music. But as the door shuts behind you, the sounds quickly fade, replaced by a silence. You find yourself in a room that looks just like your home, but there are no exits, no windows. The music starts playing again with the same exact one song and The laughter never changes. Youre stuck in a place that is warm and safe yet hollow, doomed to wander in it forever. </p>
