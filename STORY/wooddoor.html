<h1>Your Fate</h1>
<p>As soon as you step through the door, smoke blinds you. The screams grow louder. You try to turn back, but it's too late. The floor gives way, and you fall. You land in a vast pit where echoes of your deepest fears chase you, tormenting you for eternity. You become just another faint scream seeping through the crack in the door. </p>
