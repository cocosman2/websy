<h1>Your Fate</h1>
<p>The door creaks as you open it, and a chill brushes against your skin. Darkness fills the space beyond, silent and still. You step forward, and in the distance, a faint tunnel comes into view, dimly lit. Compelled by instinct, you follow it. Just as the silence begins to press in, a flicker of light appears ahead, soft, warm, real.
Youâ€™ve found it, the way out. </p>
